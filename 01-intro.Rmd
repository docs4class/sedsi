This is just a cool place to put stuff.

## Or a figure

```{r echo=FALSE}
time_with_bob_and_wilma_andrews <- seq(1,100, length = 10)
my_personal_happiness <- c(1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,0256,512)
plot(time_with_bob_and_wilma_andrews, my_personal_happiness, pch = 19, type = "b")
```

## Or an Image

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(("_images/bob.jpg"))
knitr::include_graphics(("_images/wilma.jpg"))
```

## Or an Equation

Here is a fun equation for my SEDSI DASI friends.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

# Workflow Summary

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim = c(8, 6)}
knitr::include_graphics("_images/r.jpg")
```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim = c(8, 6)}
knitr::include_graphics("_images/rstudio.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim = c(8, 6)}
knitr::include_graphics("_images/github.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.dim = c(8, 6)}
knitr::include_graphics("_images/netlify.png")
```
