# Real life example

::: {.rmdimportant}

It's nice to know exactly what you did when your original data requires wrangling.

:::

Conflicts and students honors... 

```{r echo=FALSE}
EBA <- read.csv("C:/Users/jtturner/Desktop/EBA dept conflicts - Dashboard - MultiColumn1.csv")
library(dplyr)
q1 <- EBA %>% 
  select(NAME, TOTAL.HOURS, PC.HOURS, ADMIT.TERM) %>% 
  arrange((ADMIT.TERM))
head(q1, 15)
q1[20:30,]
```


# Some Options

> This is just a cool place to put stuff^[Footnotes are always neat. And useful. Like this one!].

Like a schedule, for example:

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[]. Like this one.1

## Or a figure

```{r echo=FALSE}
time_with_bob_and_wilma_andrews <- seq(1,100, length = 10)
my_personal_happiness <- c(1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,0256,512)
plot(time_with_bob_and_wilma_andrews, my_personal_happiness, pch = 19, type = "b")
```

## Or an Image 

### Hero 1

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(("_images/bob.jpg"))
```

### Hero 2

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(("_images/wilma.jpg"))
```

## Or an Equation

Here is a **fun** equation for my SEDSI DASI friends:

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

## Or a table of something

### Fun example table

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:8], 10), booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 10 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```
